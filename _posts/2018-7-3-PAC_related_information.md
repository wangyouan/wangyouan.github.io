# Some definition

## Political Action Committee (PAC): 
A political committee that is neither a party committee nor an authorized committee of a candidate.

* _Separate segregated funds (SSFs)_: PACs directly or indirectly established, administered or financially supported by a corporation or labor organization.
* _Non-connected PACs_: PACs without such a corporate or labor sponsor.

Some type of PACs are listed below

### Leadership PAC
A political committee that is directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained or controlled by a candidate or an individual holding federal office, but is not an authorized committee of the candidate or officeholder and is not affiliated with an authorized committee of a candidate or officeholder.

### Lobbyist/Registrant PAC
Any political committee established or controlled by a person who is a current registrant under Lobbying Disclosure Act or an individual who is named on a current registration or report filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act.

### Super PAC
A political committee that makes only independent expenditures may solicit and accept _unlimited contributions_ from individuals, corporations, labor organizations and other political committees. It may not accept contributions from foreign nationals, federal contractors, national banks or federally chartered corporations. See [AO 2010-11](https://www.fec.gov/data/legal/advisory-opinions/2010-11/). Such committees, also known as independent expenditure only committees, must register with the Commission and comply with all applicable reporting requirements of the Act.

### Hybrid PAC
A committee that, in addition to making contributions, establishes a separate bank account to deposit and withdraw funds raised in unlimited amounts from individuals, corporations, labor organizations and/or other political committees, consistent with the stipulated judgment in _Carey v. FEC_. The funds maintained in this separate account will not be used to make contributions, whether direct, in-kind or via coordinated communications, or coordinated expenditures, to federal candidates or committees.
