> We examine whether the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uniformly enforces the Clean Air Act for politically connected and unconnected firms using a close election setting. We find no difference in regulated pollutant emissions or EPA investigations between the two groups, though connected firms experience less regulatory enforcement and lower penalties. These results are more pronounced for firms connected to politicians capable of influencing regulatory bureaucrats and for connected firms that are more important to their supported politicians. Taken together, our results show that campaign contributions can indirectly benefit firms by way of reduced environmental regulatory enforcement and penalties.

> This paper empirically analyzes pollution abatement regulation within the context of the Clean Air Act's nonattainment status designation and shows that financial constraints are an important determinant of whether spending on mandatory pollution abatement crowds out or stimulates R&D investment and capital expenditure. We show that spending on mandatory pollution abatement and other investments are complements for financially unconstrained firms but substitutes for constrained firms. Financially unconstrained firms invest more and have lower current profits but higher future profits; financially constrained firms invest less and have stable current profits but lower long-term profits.

> Many policymakers and practitioners argue that corporations may become more stakeholder focused if employees are given more power. We study the causal impact of unionization on stakeholders by analyzing how close labor union elections affect environmental and social (E&S) scores. We find that unionization is associated with an increase in internal social scores that primarily benefit employees and a decrease in external E&S scores that primarily benefit non-employees. The negative effects on external E&S are amplified when firms have greater financial constraints. The effects on both internal and external E&S are magnified when labor unions have more bargaining power. Our results suggest that policymakers consider implications for all stakeholders before implementing policies that prioritize the corporate influence of one stakeholder group.

> We argue that the greater tax planning of politically connected firms documented in prior literature depends critically on firms' financial conditions, because political connections help financially constrained firms access external financing and consequently reduce their incentives to use tax planning as a source of internal financing. We find that after a plausibly exogenous increase in political connections, although financially unconstrained firms increase their tax planning, constrained firms decrease it. Moreover, constrained firms are more likely to obtain new external debt financing and their costs of debt are also lower after increased political connections. Importantly, the decreases in tax planning are more pronounced for constrained firms with new external debt, and when the connected politicians serve on the banking-related committees. Taken together, our paper highlights the importance of financial constraints in understanding the tax planning of politically connected firms.
